#  Muscle_Volume_Sculptor
 Blender add-on to create volumetric muscles 
 
# Niva Muscle Analyzer
 This add-on exports muscle metrics 
 Note that for this add-on to work, muscles need to follow a specific naming system and parent-child hierarchy. 
 This naming and hierachy are automatically generated when using the Muscle_Volume_Sculptor add-on.
 If using only the Niva Muscle Analyzer in isolation, make sure that each muscle is grouped and named as follows:
